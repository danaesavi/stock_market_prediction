Problem and motivation

\section{Objectives}
Design and implement a stock market price prediction model using a recurrent neural network.

Compare the performance of the first model to two other predictive machine learning models, specifically, a feed forward artificial neural network model and a support vector machine model.

\section{Methodology}
The rest of this work is organized as follows: in the next chapter machine learning and deep learning and time series are introduced. First we explain the McCulloch and Pitts's Neuron model in order to easily understand the traditional neural networks. Then we explain support vector machines as an optimization of neural networks.
Next, we move to deep learning and study the recurrent neural networks as well as some techniques to optimize them. This includes regularization, gradient descent variants and gradient descent optimization algorithms. Finally, we explain how recurrent neural networks can be used to model time series events. 

In  chapter 3, we show how we can represent stock market prices as time series vectors and we also show the architecture for the three models. Then, we exhibit and analyze  the results of the tests, and finally we draw the conclusions in the final chapter.
